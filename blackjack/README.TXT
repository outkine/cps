# Blackjack
## Made with <3 and coffee by Anton Outkine

This is a terminal-based version of blackjack. All you have to do is run the main method in the `Game` class, and you can start playing! You, the player, start with a balance of 100, and play rounds with the goal of increasing that balance. The game will guide you through this, but most of the time you either just have to type `Y/N` or a number.

Have fun!
